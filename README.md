# Nearby Shops

This is a solution for [this web coding challenge](https://github.com/hiddenfounders/web-internship-cc).

This is a mini project developed with Java/Spring Boot (Back-end) and AngularJs (front-end).

The concept: web application that allows users to see the list of nearby shops, as well as to keep track of their favorite ones.

To try this application on your localhost, you need first to install a MongoDB dump shops database.
